# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I quickly came up with what I do throughout the day to make my schedule.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
Nothing was appearing on the screen, and I wasn’t sure why, but after checking the browser console, I just needed to wait for the delayed content to load. Once I waited a few seconds, the simulation started working. It reminded me that setTimeout doesn't run code instantly and you have to be patient with it.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This assignment taught me that async code doesn't run right away. You can space things out using time, which helps simulate a schedule or animation.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a random mood swing twist with emojis after the third activity.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
Real life is much more random and things don’t always go as planned, but this shows how events can happen one after another.
